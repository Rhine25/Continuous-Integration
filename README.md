# Autobuild

This is a solution that aims at handling compilation in a continuous integration process

## How to use

1. Make sure you have Python 3.0+ installed (this is not guaranteed to work under Python 2.0 but it may)
2. Copy & paste the XML, python script and css file wherever you like.
3. Edit the XML file with the projects you'd like to add to contiuous integration.
4. Setup a cronjob / scheduled task to launch the script
